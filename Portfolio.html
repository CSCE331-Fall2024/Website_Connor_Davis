      <h3>Aggie BlackJack</h3>
      <p>During the 2023 Howdy Hack Hackathon competition hosted by A&M, I partnered with another developer to create a web browser game of blackjack. 
        This version of blackjack had completely custom assets that were designed to show A&M traditions or references to the campus culture
        This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and most of the assets that were used were created using a combination of microsoft
        paint or adobe photoshop. The challenge of creating this project at the time was the rules of the hackathon. These rules restricted development
        time to a total of 24 hours, limited available help to just myself and my team member, and required us to have come up with our ideas the day of the 
        event. Creating this project was a fun challenge despite its lack of technical complexity; being given a limited time frame in which I met my
        teammate for the first time the day of the competition and first experienced full creative liberty on my own development process.

      <h3>SecuroChat</h3>
      <p>SecuroChat was a full stack development project I worked on with a group of developers for the Aggie Coding Club in 2023. This application 
        was designed as a messaging app supporting end-to-end encryption and a database to store and facilitate message sending. This project was
        developed over the course of four months in which I contributed as a backend developed and a security researcher for the encryption method
         we would eventually decide to use. The project was written in JavaScript and developed using React Native, Node.js, WebSocket, and SQL. The 
        database itself was hosted through Amazon Web Services and finished in time for presentation at the Aggie Coding Club project presentation event 
        at the end of the semester.

      <h3>Homework Scheduler</h3>
      <p>This project was a simple scheduling app that was designed to send system notifications and an email to users whenever an event they entered was
        tiggered. Written in 2020 during my senior year of highschool this project is entirely written in C# in visual studio.</p>

      <h3>This Website</h3>
      <p>Written in 2024 using nothing but HTML and CSS for the layouts with a little bit of javascript to enable changing between visual styles, this website
        is intended to show off my achievements and experience in software development all in one centralized project.
